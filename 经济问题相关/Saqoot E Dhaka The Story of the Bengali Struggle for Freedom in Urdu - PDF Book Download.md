# Saqoot-e-Dhaka: A Historical Account of the Fall of Dhaka in 1971
 
Saqoot-e-Dhaka (The Fall of Dhaka) is a book written by Syed Zaid Zaman Hamid, a Pakistani political commentator and analyst. The book narrates the events that led to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971, when East Pakistan seceded from West Pakistan after a bloody civil war and a military intervention by India. The book claims to expose the "hidden truths" behind the tragedy and the role of various actors, such as the Awami League, the Mukti Bahini, the Indian government, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Pakistani military and political leadership.
 
The book is based on historical documents, eyewitness accounts, and personal experiences of the author, who was a young boy living in Dhaka at the time of the war. The book aims to provide a balanced and objective perspective on the causes and consequences of the partition of Pakistan, and to challenge the "propaganda" and "distortions" that have been spread by some quarters. The book also offers some lessons and recommendations for the future of Pakistan and its relations with Bangladesh and India.
