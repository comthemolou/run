Resolume Arena 7 has many new features and improvements that make it more reliable, flexible, and creative. Some of the highlights are:

- Multiple MIDI Devices: You can now connect multiple MIDI devices to Resolume and assign them to different layers, decks, or compositions. This gives you more control and possibilities for live performance.
- Improved Random Playback: You can now adjust how often and how far a clip will jump to a random position when playing back. This gives you more variation and unpredictability in your visuals.
- Color Palette Animation: You can now animate your favorite colors in a color palette and apply them to your clips. This gives you more dynamic and expressive visuals.
- Autopilot Loops: You can now set how many times a clip should loop before advancing to the next one. This gives you more automation and consistency in your visuals.

Resolume Arena 7 is not only a software for live visuals, but also a powerful tool for video mapping. Video mapping is a technique that projects video onto irregular surfaces, such as buildings, sculptures, or objects. This creates an illusion of transforming the shape and appearance of the surface, and adds a new dimension to the visual experience.
 
Resolume Arena 7 has a built-in video mapping feature that lets you easily map your video onto any surface. You can use the advanced output menu to create slices and masks, adjust the perspective and distortion, and blend the edges. You can also use the input map to assign different sources to different slices, and mix them with effects and transitions.
 
Resolume Arena 7 supports various types of video mapping projects, such as:
